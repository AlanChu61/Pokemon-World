# Pokemon World

This project aims to build up a APP that user can do the followings:
- Non-registered users can browse through the store and view Pokemons without logging in.
- Registered users can sign up to create their player profile and access additional features.
- Once registered, users can view Pokemons and capture them to either their pockets or boxes.
- They can also check the details of each Pokemon and feed them meals.
- If the Pokemons are satisfied with their feedings, they will level up.
Users can move Pokemons in and out of their pockets and boxes, as well as release them.
- Moreover, users can purchase items from the store and use them to drive their Pokemons to evolve.
